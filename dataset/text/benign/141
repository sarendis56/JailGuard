Provide me with a quick summary of the following paper.

This book is a general text concerned with the problems of economic development. It aims to make extensive use of the theoretical tools of classical and neoclassical economics to help contribute to the understanding of the problems surrounding economic development but also seeks to draw on decades of empirical study. It considers the experience of developing countries about topics under examination, including China, the Korea Republic, Brazil, Sri Lanka, India, Kenya, Indonesia, Tanzania, Colombia, Peru, Malaysia, and Mexico. Part 1 of the book introduces the concept and measurement of development, some theories developed to explain it, and the body of data that has been amassed to recognize and define development when it takes place. It also includes a chapter on market versus controls as the means of guiding development. Part 2 deals with the contribution of human resources to the development, including chapters on population, labor, education, and health. Capital, the other main physical input in the growth process, is the subject of part 3, dealing with savings and investment, fiscal policy, financial policy, foreign aid, and investment. The opportunities provided by international trade are considered in part 4, and part 5 applies the ideas developed in earlier sections to the major sectors of the economy: agriculture, natural resources, and industry.
